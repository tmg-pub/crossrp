-- Some terminology:
--   FULLNAME: A player name and realm in the normal game format, 
--              e.g. Tammya-MoonGuard.
--   BAND: A set of people that have the same faction and realm.
--   DEST/DESTINATION: A player name and a band.
--   LINK: A link between two Battle.net friends. Both sides of a link must
--           have Cross RP and be "hosting" for a link to be formed.
--   BRIDGE: A player local to you (on the same realm and faction) that has one
--            or more links to other realms or factions. The player themselves
--            are also a valid bridge if they have links and are hosting.
-- Bands are formatted as <number><A/H>, meaning the realm ID and Alliance
--  or Horde. e.g. "1H" is Moon Guard Horde. Some realms are selected as
--  "primo", which means they have a single digit realm ID.
-- Destinations are formatted as <player><band>, <player> being their toon name
--  without their realm attached (as that's part of the band). e.g. "Tammya1A"
--  for Tammya-MoonGuard Alliance.
-- For connected realms, there may be multiple bands that are linked, and the
--  one with the lowest realm ID will be used as the "base band", which is
--  basically for routing purposes. The links and bridge structs are indexed
--  by "base" bands where applicable.

-- This is our main sending API. The simplest example of using this is:

-- This will send the message "hoi" to Catnia on Moon Guard (1) Horde, no
--  matter where you are located, so long as you have a bridge to that band.
-- To receive the message, it must be registered through 
--  `Proto.SetMessageHandler`. 
-- e.g. `Proto.SetMessageHandler( "hoi", MyHandler )`
--
-- `dest` can be:
--   - "local"  Send (broadcast) to our Cross RP channel.
--   - "all"    Send (broadcast) to all bands that we know of.
--   - "active" Send (broadcast) to all bands that we ahve touched recently.
--   - <band>   A band name sends a broadcasted message to that band.
--   - <dest>   A complete destination sends a whispered message to that user.
--   - <local dest> A local destination is something that "works" but that's
--               just an odd request.
-- `msg` can either be a table or a string. If it's a table, the resulting
--  message is the entries concatenated together with spaces.
-- `options` is an optional table with all entries inside optional:
--    secure     Boolean - send securely.
--    priority   "LOW", "NORMAL", "FAST", or "URGENT" for the Comm layer.
--    guarantee  Basically guarantees delivery, resending if it fails (requests
--                an ACK from the routers).
--    callback   A callback to receive events about the sending status.
-- The callback function has the signature ( sender, event, data )
--   `sender` is the sender object. It will mirror the same fields that are
--    in the `options` passed in, so you can share userdata that way (just
--    watch out for internal data). `data` is the per-destination data,
--    containing the UMID and other things like time sent, what bridge, etc.
-- Events can be triggered at the sender level or the destination level. A
--  sender only has one message, but it can mirror that message to multiple
--  destinations. Per-destination events are as follows:
--    TIMEOUT     Sending failure due to unknown network problems. (NOT sure
--                 if the message went through or not).
--    LOCAL_SENT  A message was sent locally (and no further verification will
--                 be done for that message.
--    NOBRIDGE    Couldn't send to a destination, because we have no bridge
--                 for them. (Likely became unavailable after the sending
--                 started).
--    SENT        A message was put out on the line. Multiple SENTs can be 
--                 triggered, for each attempt we send the data.
--    CONFIRMED_DEST  This is triggered after we receive an ACK for a single
--                     destination.
-- Per-sender events are as follows:
--    DONE        Triggered when a sender is completely done. This is always
--                 the final event.
--    CONFIRMED   Triggered when a sender has been ack'd completely, meaning a
--                 guaranteed message was transferred successfully. "DONE"
--                 followsimmediately after.
-- Finally, one thing to really keep in mind, that while this is super
--  convenient and all, this routing protocol is based upon TRUST. There are
--  a lot of opportunities for man-in-the-middle attacks or falsified
--  information being passed around. Due to this very reason, we do not
--  endorse any type of "global" Cross RP chat, as impersonation would be both
--                                       too easy to do, and too hard to trace.
